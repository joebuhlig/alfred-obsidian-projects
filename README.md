Alfred Workflow for managing project folders and note files in Obsidian.

You will be asked about setting variables on import. All of the following locations can be easily grabbed by navigating to the location of the folder or file and selecting it. Then right-click it and hold down the option key. Then select "Copy <your file/folder> as Pathname." Paste that value into each of the variables.

projectFolder = The folder where you want to store your project support documents.

projectArchive = The folder where you want to archive completed projects.

projectListFile = The master file to use when creating a map of all projects.

projectNotesFolder = The folder where you want to store the note file that is created for each project.

projectNotesArchive = The folder where you want to archive the project note files.
